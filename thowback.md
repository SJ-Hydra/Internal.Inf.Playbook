# Payload Creation, Staged/Stageless Payloads
msfvenom -l payloads    

Stageless payloads by design are larger because they contain everything required to land a reverse shell back on your box in a nice and neat style.
Staged payloads are only part of the designation needed to spawn a shell. The staged aspect of the payload can assist with AV evasion and size reduction.
